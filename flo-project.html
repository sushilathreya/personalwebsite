                    Women often don’t feel understood and need a non-judgmental guide through their journey of
                    womanhood. That’s where Flo comes in.

                <h3>Understanding Flo</h3>
                <p> <b>The journey</b><br>
                    Flo was launched globally with an initial release in 2015. It hit the Indian markets on April 12,
                    2016. In January 2024, Flo had 62 million Monthly Active Users worldwide with an estimated 3.5% of
                    that in India.<br><br>
                    <b>Core value prop</b><br>
                    Flo is every woman’s bestie for life. Damini uses Flo’s cycle tracking and information to avoid
                    embarrassing situations, manage her symptoms, plan her trips, and stay pregnance free. When she’s
                    ready for it, Flo seamlessly transitions to help her in her journey to conceive and in each step of
                    her pregnancy adventure

                    <br><br><b>Key Product Insights</b><br>
                    ❌ Lack of context: The content shown on the app is not specific to the problem that the user is
                    dealing with. Eg: A lot of users that we spoke to had conditions such as PCOS, but the content on
                    the app was not targeted to their condition. These women are going to have irregular periods, but
                    every time the period was irregular, the app prompted them to check if they were pregnant.

                    <br><br>✅ Strong community: Flo has a great community and an excellent search feature within the
                    community

                    <br><br>

                <h3>Your guiding light ✨</h3>
                <b>Introducing Flora the Firefly - your guiding light through womanhood</b><br>
                <img class="project-details-testimonials clickable-image" src="images/introducing-flora.png"
                    onclick=openLightbox(this)>
                <br><b>Who is Flora?</b>
                <p>Flora is an immortal firefly who has lived for hundreds of years. While she’s lived for so long, she
                    never ages and is still young at heart. Throughout her long lifetime, she has traveled across the
                    world and has seen the joys and struggles of women across places and across eras.<br><br>
                    Flora has supported hundreds of thousands of women through their womanhood. From their early years
                    of menstruation, to dealing with menstrual challenges, to helping them bring new life into this
                    world, and beyond.<br><br>
                    Flora is caring, friendly, non-judgmental, and most important of all extremely knowledgable about
                    everything related to womanhood. It’s no coincidence that she shares her name with the Roman goddess
                    of spring and fertility.
                </p><br>
                <br><b>Why did we create a mascot for Flo?</b>
                <p>Flo is already a woman’s bestie, guiding her through the thick and thin of womanhood. Women face
                    deeply personal and serious problems that they don’t feel a lot of people in their immediate circle
                    will relate to. They find it difficult to trust a faceless app.<br><br>
                    The mascot will add a face to the brand that gives women someone to relate to when they think of
                    Flo.<br><br>
                    Things that will be positively impacted by a mascot:
                <ol>
                    <li>Brand awareness and recall: A mascot will help Flo stand out in the extremely crowded market
                    </li>
                    <li>Customer Loyalty: Users will be more loyal to the brand if the connection with the mascot is
                        good</li>
                    <li>Engagement: Users will interact with the app more</li>
                    <li>Acquisition and revenue: Airbnb reported record revenues of $2.9B in 2022. Majority of their
                        marketing spend is on brand and CEO, Brian Chesky believes that shifting from <a
                            href="https://www.marketingweek.com/airbnb-earnings-surge-effective-marketing-spend/">performance
                            marketing to brand marketing</a> has been a core driver of the growth</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <br><b>How will women interact with Flo?</b>
                <p>We built an in-depth launch strategy + designed Flora’s app interaction for the Capstone. I will just
