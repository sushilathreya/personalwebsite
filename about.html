        <h2>About Sushil Athreya</h2>
        <p>Namaskara üôè and welcome to my website! Looking for someone to help you with your growth marketing and comms?
            I‚Äôm your man. I have 5+ years of experience in growth, sales, and marketing in drones, fintech, and crypto.
            While these industries are at the cutting edge, they are also complex in terms of regulation. This has made
            me extremely comfortable with uncertainty. </p>

        <p>I‚Äôve helped generate high 6 figures of revenue and influenced millions of dollars of transaction volume.</p>
        <p><strong>If you‚Äôre looking for someone to help you build long term, sustainable revenue - look no
                further.</strong></p>

        <h2>Beyond Work: My Passions</h2>

        <div class="hobby">
            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>I've played 40+ gigs with my rock fusion band, 'The Eighth Chakra'. I'm also a beatboxer and I produce solo music once in every blue moon üåë. Check out my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4nsXL03vcRJbN2FRFjZW6T">Spotify</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="hobby">
            <h3>Muay Thai</h3>
            <p>I've been training Muay Thai since May 2024 and it's taught me a lot about disclipline, gratitude, and the power of repetition in learning. I now start my day with an intense Muay Thai session and I hope to have a fight soon ü¶æ</p>
        </div>

        <div class="hobby">
            <h3>Sports</h3>
            <p>I was the vice captain of my university football ‚öΩÔ∏è team and led the team to our first ever trophy. More recently, I got obsessed with badminton üè∏. In Jan 2023 I was worse than all my friends. By May, my obsession had made me the best.  </p>

            <h3>Crypto</h3>
            <p>Humans love owning "memes". There's no reason that has to be limited to the physical realm. That's why I am and always will be a huge proponent of digital ownership.</p>
